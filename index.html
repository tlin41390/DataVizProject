	    <p>For a while now Graphics Processing Units also known as (GPUs) have been the goal for PC builders to acqure.
		However, in the current climate it is practically impossible to purchase a GPU at MSRP or even find one in stock.
		For those that are in the market, the prices are ramped up heaviliy to the point where it is no longer justifiable to purchase it.
		This project will explore the fluxuating prices of GPUs, as well as visualize how short the time is for GPUs being in stock. I will compare
		the price of Etherum to the changing prices of GPUs as well as represent how many of each GPU have been bought in a monthly basis. With this project
		I hope to find how much the GPU market has increased or decreased in prices. the  trend in gpu prices relative to changes in cryptocurrency prices,
		as well as the general times until GPUs go out of stock.</p>

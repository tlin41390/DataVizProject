      <h1 class="title">About</h1>
      <p>For a while now Graphics Processing Units also known as (GPUs) have been the goal for PC builders to acqure.
        However, in the current climate it is practically impossible to purchase a GPU at MSRP or even find one in
        stock.
        For those that are in the market, the prices are ramped up heaviliy to the point where it is no longer
        justifiable to purchase it.
        This project will explore the fluxuating prices of GPUs, as well as visualize how short the time is for GPUs
        being in stock. I will compare
        the price of Etherum to the changing prices of GPUs as well as represent how many of each GPU have been bought
        in a monthly basis. With this project
        I hope to find how much the GPU market has increased or decreased in prices. the trend in gpu prices relative to
        changes in cryptocurrency prices,
        as well as the general times until GPUs go out of stock. </p><br>

      <h1 class="title">Proportional Circles of Aggregate GPUs Sold Within Seven On Ebay</h1>


      <p>This is a simple proportional circle visualization that represents the total sold for different GPU models
        within
        half a year. The bigger the circle, the more the model is sold. Hover over the circles to display the GPU model
        and the quanitity sold. The green circles represent the Nvidia models and the orange circles represents the AMD
        models. This data was collected using Tom's Hardware's monthly tracker. Generally, we can see a larger
        representation of Nvidia GPUS as they dominate over AMD in terms of units sold for the most part.</p>

        This is a heatmap that represents the quanitity of units sold over the course of 6 months, from September 2021
        all the way to February 2022. You can hover over the rectangles in order to get the specific values for each of
        the months for dates.

      <p>This Line Chart here displays the price trend of various GPUS from September 2021 to March 2022. The dropdown
        menu on top will display the GPUs from both AMD, and Nvidia. The line chart will update when the user selects
        what model they want to compare in the drop down menu. Hovering over the dots will display basic information on
        how much the GPU costs at that specific month. The bottom of the chart represents MSRP, so the higher the line,
        the more expensive it is relative to its MSRP.

      <p>These here are small multiples of different histograms that measures the time it takes for GPUs to sell out. I
        scraped the data from an active tracker and then represent the GPUs with the most notifications. The bins
        represent the minutes in increments of 5, all the way up to one hour. The y axis represents the frequency of
        distribution between sell out times. The color represents the company with Nvidia being green and AMD being
        orange. I also incorporated hovering where users can hover over a rectangle to see
        the frequency as well as the range of values that are in that rectangle.

      <p>I created violin plots as a means to represent the distribution of GPUs that sell out in a different manner.
        This provides a overview of where the main distribution lies. The advantage is that I can put more
        visualizations of the GPUs on the chart.</p>
